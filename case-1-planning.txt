- According to 'Performing Sniffing and Spoofing Attack Against ADS-B and Mode S using Software Define Radio' paper by 
    TajDini et. al, "ADS-B equipment broadcast a lot of helpful information like GPS location, ground speed, altitude, and 
    much more almost every single second, a random time between 0.8 to 1.2 seconds". Could use this range in spoofer.py?
- Increase spoofed signal power over time to implement gradual spoofing?
- Modify value of spoof_probability in n_Scen_adsb_attack.py and spoofer.py
- Modify values of noise to decrease SNR value and introduce more noise in the channel
